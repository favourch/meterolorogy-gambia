The Gambia
The National Meteorology department of the Gambia operates a network of 10 weather monitoring stations across the nation. All the stations are provided with mobile phones in order to communicate their data to a central point located at Banjul International Airport. The rate of transmission is far from satisfactory as staff in the field would complain about their calls being rejected/ignored and those located at the collection point complaining that those in the field are failing to communicate their data. One possible solution is to use SMS technology to submit the data to a central database that is accessible to the users at the central location.
